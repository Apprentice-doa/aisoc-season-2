# AISOC ML Workflow Tutorial

This repository contains a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow tutorial using Python and Scikit-Learn. The tutorial demonstrates how to load, clean, engineer features, train, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model on Amazon sales data.

## Overview

This tutorial covers the following key phases of a typical ML project:

1. **Data Engineering**  
   Loading data, cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

2. **Model Engineering**  
   Training simple and complex models (Linear Regression and Random Forest), and evaluating their performance.

3. **Code Engineering**  
   Saving the best model for production and simulating production predictions and monitoring.

## Contents

- `amazon_sale_report.csv` (expected in Downloads folder) — Amazon sales data file (not included in repo)
- `sales_model.pkl` — Saved ML model after training (generated by script)
- `ml_workflow_tutorial.py` — Main Python script containing the full tutorial code
- `README.md` — This file

---

## How to Run

1. Place your `amazon_sale_report.csv` file in your Downloads folder (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\`).

2. Run the Python script `ml_workflow_tutorial.py`. It will:

   - Load the data (or create sample data if file not found)
   - Perform data cleaning and feature engineering
   - Train Linear Regression and Random Forest models
   - Evaluate and compare model performance
   - Save the best model to `sales_model.pkl`
   - Simulate production predictions and simple monitoring

3. Review the printed output for insights and model performance.
